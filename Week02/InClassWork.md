# In-class Work
Complete the following exercises in your file

### Creating variables
Create the variables for each of the following types:
- bool
- double
- int
- string
	
### Assigning variables
Assign the values below to the appropriate variable created (you can assign value at variable creation or on a separate line):
- "Just some random text!"
- 9001
- 3.14
- false
	
### Writing variables
Write the value of each variable to the console window. Make sure the written results match what you would expect!

### Using a method
Take all of the code you used above to print out variable values, and put it in its own method!

1. Create the new method definition (**define** the method)
1. Copy the code from the `Main` method into your new method
1. **Call** the method from the `Main` method
1. Run the program, and make sure it behaves the same as it did before!
